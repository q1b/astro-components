# Positioning

For Positioning a component inside a element ( container ), is way easier today then before, as now All Browser supports **flexbox** and **grid** using them you can create complex layout design, position ( \*elements ) according to the size of a container, but still you want something more specific that does the work of Positioning elements for you, then you can give try to this library.

## Like, What it does for you ?

Just simple to use Component to make it easy to position HTML Elements, using css behind the scenes without you worrying about CSS and expect everything to work perfectly.

## Why I made it ?

Made this Simple Component for My Personal Project, It's was **looking useful** So, I Thought ðŸ¤” to share it as a npm package

# How to use it ?

This library woundn't have a learning curve, because

-   typescript intellisense
-   uses simple name conventions

## Example

### Simple

This example is positioning the elements apart from each other, placing them far most possible from each other within the container's boundary (means `width` and `height`)

```astro
---
import { Position } from 'position-component'
---
<Position center col >
    <!-- h1,h2,...,section,article,main,...,div,span -->
</Position>
```

```astro
---
import { Position } from 'position-component'
---
<Position col apart class="w-64 h-96 bg-slate-1000">
	<div class="w-4 h-4"></div>
	<div class="w-4 h-4"></div>
	<div class="w-4 h-4"></div>
</Position>
```
